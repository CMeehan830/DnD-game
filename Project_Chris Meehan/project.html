			<h3>Welcome to Dangers and Druggies</h3>
			<p>Set in the mythical land of Definitelynotdetroit, this choice-based adventure game throws you onto the streets of a city teeming with addicts and dealers.<br/>
			You must use your wits and weapon of choice to survive in this drug-ridden land.<br/>
			Fight or flight! Decide whether to fight, try to run from, or walk past your opponent. Careful, you may not always be able to leave.<br/>
			Be warned, your actions have consequences! The choices you make will affect your Danger level. The higher your Danger, the more likely you'll attract unwanted attention from the authorities.
			If you run out of health, or your Danger level reaches max, you will lose.
